## Creating tables

### The `CREATE TABLE` command

The `CREATE TABLE` command is used to make new database tables. An example:

This example shows the syntax for `CREATE TABLE`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
  graduated BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT 'f',
  cohort INTEGER NOT NULL,
  resume TEXT,
  financial_aid_per_year NUMERIC(7,2),
  enrolled_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
```

`CREATE TABLE` takes two arguments: the name of the table and a list of columns. Each column has a name, data type, and options. The columns in the above example explained:

* `id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY`: The `id` column is of type `SERIAL`, which is an integer that is automatically incremented and set when a row is inserted. The option `PRIMARY KEY` says that we will use this column as a unique identifier for each row. This requires that the column is both unique and not nullable.
* `name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL`: The `name` column is a string with a maximum length of 100 characters. It cannot have a null value.
* `email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE`: The `email` column is a string with a maximum length of 100 characters. It _can_ be null, but if it has a value, it must be a unique value.
* `graduated BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT 'f'`: The `graduated` column is a true/false value. It cannot be null, but if you insert a row and do not set the value, it will automatically be set to false.
* `cohort INTEGER NOT NULL`: The `cohort` column is an integer value and cannot be null.
* `resume TEXT`: The `resume` column stores strings of arbitrary length. It can be null.
* `financial_aid_per_year NUMERIC(7,2)`: The `financial_aid_per_year` column is a decimal value with precision (total number of digits) of 7 and scale (digits right of the decimal point) of 2. It can be null.
* `enrolled_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL`: The `enrolled_at` column is a date and time value and cannot be null.

There are more datatypes for columns, including complex ones that can hold multiple values. Some of the common simple ones are:

* REAL (floating point number)
* DATE
* TIME
* INTERVAL (amount of time)

### Deleting tables

To delete a table, use `DROP TABLE <tablename>`. If you want PostgreSQL to not throw an error if the table does not exist -- this is a nice thing to put at the top of a schema definition file -- use `DROP TABLE <tablename> IF EXISTS`.
