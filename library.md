- Patrons can check out books.
- Books know if they are currently checked out and by who.
- When a book is checked out, a record is kept of the book and checkout timestamp, but not of the patron. Create a function to checkout books and another to check them back in.
- Write a query to show all overdue books and turn it into a function.
- Write a query to add fine records for the current day. This will be run each day. Just in case it's run multiple times, use INSERT ON CONFLICT.
